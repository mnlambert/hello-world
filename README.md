# hello-world
My First Repository

Hello! I am Mahogany Lambert and I am a new programmer and am learning how to use GitHub! This is my first time really using GitHub and I am excited to see what cool things it can do and what the community can help me with! Yay! I like coding (web development specifically), playing video games and hanging out with friends.
